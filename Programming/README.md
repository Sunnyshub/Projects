# Sunny's Readme
# McHome Delivering food globally to your local McDonalds

# Short Description
Our app is meant to inform the user about the new limited time offer items McDonalds has. These limited time offers are burgers and food from other countries, like France, America and Japan. It also makes them keep coming back by the use of loyalty points and rewards. Lastly it offers a coupon QR which give discounts when enough points have been collected.

# Which Programs were used
Visual studio code, figma and GIT were all used in order to optimize this app towards its best version. The coding languages css/html and js were used. Visual Studio Code was used to code. Figma was used in order to create prototypes and finally GIT was used in order to merge our code. 

# Challenges I faced
This was the first project I had to use media queries a lot. It was a bit intimidating for me but once I finally mastered doing it I was finally able to understand how it was done effectively and it proved to be quite amazing. 
Another challenging moment I had was creating my first page. Since this one has been copied 4 times also by other teammembers, making the first one is always the hardest ofcourse. Finally the carrousel which is present in all country pages (I did American page and Japan page) took a bit longer to make then I initially thought. I did not have to do much else since I was doing mostly the video in the project. For me the hardest part was using git effectively. At first I accidentally kept working in a main branch and then I made my own. In my own branch I kept getting errors which didn't allow me to merge it anymore and it was basically the last 2 days this happened so that was really stressful. Eventually a teammate helped me but I still don't know if I can prevent this in the future. 

# Which features are going to be implemented in future
I plan to create pins that symbolize both the country of origin and Mcdonald's at the same time. As the focus at the time didn't seem to relate to our intended products. Make the reward page more accessible. This is to encourage users to use points. Updates to our pages, for example, our login page.  Overall, our team should turn our focus on rewards

# How to install the project?
Step 1 go to the website: http://i477572.hera.fhict.nl/testformd/login-page.html
Step 2 click on login as guest
Step 3 go to the taskbar and on the right there should be an option to download.

In case you are on mobile I imagine you can donwload it too by tapping on the 3 dots and then finding the download button. 

NOTE this app consistenly only works in specific mobile sizes. Currently it does not work on desktop

# How to use the project
After seeing the logo animation. You will see the login page and you can then login as a guest since the login feature does not work yet. After this you will be met with the McHome page (See instructions below)

# Taskbar
You can go to 4 pages at any time. No matter what page you are on. These pages are the McHome page, the coupon page, the point page and the logout/login page. 

# McHome
After this you are met with the McHome page. From here you can go to 4 countries shown, which are the American, French, Japanese and finally Greek page. By clicking on one of these you will all end up in the same layout just with different colors, burgers and facts. These we call the countrypage. 

# Countrypages
The countrypages show the burgers from each country and it says what name they have. There will be a slider which currently shows 3 burgers but this can be changed anytime. It also showcases a main burger which will be the most attractive looking burger of the countries. If you scroll down you are met with the funfacts API. Which generates a different fact everytime you refresh. If you progress from here you click on a burger and then you'll be met with the QR pages.

# Burger QR pages
These pages all are working qr codes which you can scan inside of the McDonalds to get a discount on your burger. What you can also do on this page is check the nutritional value of each burger. This is where the flow of the page ends it does not go further then this. So what you should do now is click any of the taskbar options.

# Coupons page
Assuming you clciked on the coupons page you can now see what 3 Coupons you have and which 3 deals there currently are. Both of these things link back to the QR pages. This is also where the flow ends

# Points page
This page showcases all of the pins and food you can get for free by collecting points which you get from buying meals at McDonalds. Clicking on any of these will make a popup that asks whether you want to buy the reward or not. After this another QR code wil be scannable.

The logout page just brings you back to the first page you see.
Now you know how to use our application
