The workshop
21.09 Section 2 had workshop about prototyping. The workshop's purpose to give an insight of what prototyping is and howe to approach
it for our projects.

The task
After the workshop we had to create a prototype of the android game "Two Dots". After that we had to give the game our own twist.
After our adittion to the game we had to test it to prove that our version is good enough to be implemented in the game itself.

The result
The board of the game is 5x5 by default. We decided to choose the middle 3x3 squares. If the player connects anything outside the small
3x3 grid, he/she looses one life(having total 3 lives). We also implemented a points system in the game. 

The test
We tested our prototype on one of our colleagues - Niels. It took him 8 minutes to complete an entire game and he did not loose interest
during the prototype testing. He did not have any major remarks at the end apart from suggesting an extra rule and a more sped-up process.
