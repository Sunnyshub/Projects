## Task
### Duo Case 4: Mood Predictor
An app that tracks the daily mood of the user and gathers data from external sources like weather, traffic for commuters, user's roster, food intake (fats, proteins, carbohydrates), physical activity (sports, walking/running/biking), activities by checking the user's calendar, amount of sleep, sexual activity, and social interactions. The app aims to identify relationships between these factors and the user's mood, ultimately predicting future moods and providing insights into the external factors that affect mood.

## Instructions
